I will link to my space when completed so you can just duplicate the space and select the paid hardware Nvidia T4 small is 
the smallest GPU HuggingFace offers which is $0.40/hour charging each minute of uptime regardless of GPU usage unless you pause the space.

I will also upload a HuggingFace CPU branch that will be free but is much slower ðŸ¤®
